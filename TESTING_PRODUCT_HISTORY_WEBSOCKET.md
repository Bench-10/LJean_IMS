1. **Setup**:
   ```
   Window 1: Product Inventory page
   Window 2: Product History modal (click "Transaction History" button)
   ```

2. **Action**: In Window 1, add a new product with quantity
   ```
   Product Name: "Test Rice 25kg"
   Quantity: 50
   Unit Cost: ₱1,200
   Unit Price: ₱1,500
   ```

3. **✅ Expected Result**: Window 2 immediately shows new entry:
   ```
   📋 New entry at top of Product History:
   - Product: "Test Rice 25kg"  
   - Quantity: 50
   - Cost: ₱1,200
   - Value: ₱60,000
   - Date: Today's date
   ```

### **Test 2: Stock Addition Updates**
1. **Action**: In Window 1, edit existing product → Add quantity only
   ```
   Select existing product
   Add Quantity: 25 (keep price same)
   ```

2. **✅ Expected Result**: Window 2 shows new history entry:
   ```
   📋 New entry appears for quantity addition:
   - Same product name
   - Quantity: 25 (additional)
   - Current date/time
   ```

### **Test 3: Price Change Only (No History Entry)**
1. **Action**: In Window 1, edit product → Change price only
   ```
   Change price from ₱1,500 to ₱1,600
   Quantity: 0 (no quantity added)
   ```

2. **✅ Expected Result**: Window 2 shows NO new entry
   ```
   ❌ No new entry in Product History (correct!)
   ✅ Inventory table shows updated price
   ```

### **Test 4: WebSocket Monitor**
1. **Open**: `websocket_test.html` in browser
2. **Connect**: Set branch ID and click "Connect"
3. **Action**: Add/update products in main app
4. **✅ Expected**: See `history-update` events in "Product History Updates" panel

## 📊 **What to Look For**

### **✅ Success Indicators:**
- New entries appear **instantly** without page refresh
- Entries show **correct data** (product, quantity, cost, value)
- **Proper ordering** (newest entries at top)
- **No duplicate entries** for price-only changes
- Console shows **WebSocket events** received

### **❌ Common Issues & Solutions:**
| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|--------|----------|
| No updates appear | Different branch users | Ensure same branch ID |
| Updates show for own changes | User ID filtering issue | Check browser console |
| Entries duplicated | Event listener not cleaned up | Refresh page |
| WebSocket not connecting | Backend port wrong | Check port 3000 |

## 🔍 **Debug Commands**

### **Browser Console:**
```javascript
// Check if history updates are being received
window.addEventListener('history-update', (e) => {
  console.log('📋 History update:', e.detail);
});

// Manual trigger test
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('history-update', {
  detail: {
    action: 'add',
    historyEntry: { product_name: 'Test', quantity_added: 10 },
    user_id: 999
  }
}));
```

### **Network Tab:**
- Look for **WebSocket connection** in Network tab
- Check for **Socket.IO polling/websocket** protocols  
- Verify **101 Switching Protocols** response
