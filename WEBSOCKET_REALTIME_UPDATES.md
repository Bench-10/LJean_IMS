# ðŸš€ WebSocket Real-Time Updates for LJean IMS

## Overview
This system provides real-time updates across all connected devices when inventory changes occur. When a user on one device adds or updates a product, all other devices viewing the inventory will see the changes immediately without needing to refresh the page.

## Features Added

### 1. **Real-Time Inventory Updates** ðŸ“¦
- When a product is added on any device, it appears instantly on all other devices
- When a product is updated (quantity, price, etc.), changes reflect immediately across all devices
- Updates are only shown to users in the same branch

### 2. **Real-Time Product Validity Updates** ðŸ“…
- New product validity entries appear instantly on the Product Validity page
- Updates include expiry status (expired, near expiry, good condition)
- Automatically calculates and updates expiry warnings

### 3. **Visual Notifications** ðŸ””
- In-app notifications show when updates are made by other users
- Different notification types for additions vs. updates
- Non-intrusive pop-up messages with automatic timeout

## How It Works

### Backend (WebSocket Server)
1. **Enhanced Server (`server.js`)**:
   - Added `broadcastInventoryUpdate()` function for inventory changes
   - Added `broadcastValidityUpdate()` function for validity changes
   - Branch-specific rooms ensure users only see updates from their branch

2. **Enhanced Inventory Service (`inventoryServices.js`)**:
   - `addProductItem()` now broadcasts inventory and validity updates
   - `updateProductItem()` broadcasts changes when products are modified
   - Includes user ID to prevent showing updates to the user who made the change

### Frontend (React Components)
1. **App Component (`App.jsx`)**:
   - Added WebSocket listeners for `inventory-update` and `validity-update` events
   - Updates product data state in real-time
   - Shows in-app notifications for changes made by other users

2. **Product Validity Component (`ProductValidity.jsx`)**:
   - Listens for custom events to update validity data
   - Handles both new additions and updates to existing validity records

## WebSocket Events

### `inventory-update`
```javascript
{
  action: 'add' | 'update',
  product: {
    product_id: number,
    product_name: string,
    quantity: number,
    unit_price: number,
    // ... other product fields
  },
  user_id: number
}
```

### `validity-update`
```javascript
{
  action: 'add' | 'update',
  product: {
    product_id: number,
    product_name: string,
    category_name: string,
    formated_date_added: string,
    formated_product_validity: string,
    near_expy: boolean,
    expy: boolean,
    // ... other validity fields
  },
  user_id: number
}
```

### `new-notification`
```javascript
{
  alert_id: number,
  alert_type: string,
  message: string,
  banner_color: string,
  user_id: number,
  user_full_name: string,
  alert_date: string,
  // ... other notification fields
}
```

## Testing Real-Time Updates

### Method 1: Multiple Browser Windows
1. Open the application in multiple browser windows
2. Login with different users (or same user in different tabs)
3. Make sure they're viewing the same branch
4. Add/update a product in one window
5. Watch it appear instantly in the other windows

### Method 2: WebSocket Test Page
1. Open `websocket_test.html` in a browser
2. Set the correct branch ID
3. Connect to the WebSocket server
4. Use the main application to add/update products
5. Watch real-time updates appear in the test page

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Make sure your frontend has the correct API URL in `frontend/.env`:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Backend runs on port 3000
```

And your backend in `.env`:
```
PORT=3000  # Backend port
```

### Branch-Based Updates
- Users only see updates from their own branch
- Branch ID is determined by user authentication
- Cross-branch updates are not visible for security

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: No more manual page refreshes needed
2. **Data Consistency**: All users see the same data simultaneously
3. **Collaboration**: Multiple users can work on inventory without conflicts
4. **Real-Time Awareness**: Users know immediately when changes are made
5. **Mobile Responsive**: Works across all devices and screen sizes

## Technical Implementation Details

### Connection Management
- WebSocket connections are automatically established when users log in
- Connections are cleaned up when users log out or close the browser
- Auto-reconnection handling for network interruptions

### Performance Optimization
- Updates are only sent to users viewing relevant pages
- User ID filtering prevents self-notification loops
- Branch-based rooms reduce unnecessary network traffic

### Data Synchronization
- Database updates and WebSocket broadcasts are atomic
- Transaction rollback includes WebSocket cleanup
- Consistent data formatting across all update types

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real-time sales updates
- [ ] Live delivery status updates
- [ ] Real-time user activity indicators
- [ ] Collaborative editing with conflict resolution
- [ ] Push notifications for mobile devices
